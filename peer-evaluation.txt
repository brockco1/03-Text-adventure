Project: Text adventure
Peer's repository: Cortland Brock



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I learned that I could use portions of words that get the idea
across while saving space, like kit for kitchen or liv for living room.
I thought that that may be confusing, but I could extrapolate just fine.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
There were a larger variety of verbs. I just used cardinal directions, I would like to use
more if I do this again.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
Maybe comment more to declare intentions.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
Which verbs to use and the descriptions could have been more
specific rather than just randomly choosing left or right.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
The verbs were not consistent, so as a user, I got confused. It switched from
cardinal directions to left/right.

 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
A description of the setting in which the adventure take place. It just says the title
of the assignment.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
It is very organized and easy to read.
